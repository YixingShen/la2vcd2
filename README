la2vcd2 is a utility to translate waveforms captured with HP logic
analyzers (e.g., HP 16500B) to a VCD file for use with a waveform viewer
application such as GTKWave.

Usage:

  ./la2vcd2 [options] signalfile...

Options:
  -ta <timefile>     times from file (mutually exclusive with -td)
  -td <time>         set delta time
  -r <radix>         set radix of next input file
  -b <count>         set bit count of next input file
  -s                 split next input file into individual bits
  -sf <bits> <name>  split a field from the next input file
  -ts <time>         set timescale of VCD file (default 1 ns)
  -mn <modulename>   set module name of signals in VCD file
  -o <vcdfile>       write VCD output to file (default stdout)

Argument syntax:
  <radix> ::= 2 | 8 | 16
  <time> ::= <integer><unit>
  <unit> ::= s|ms|us|ns|ps|fs
  <bits> ::= <bitr>|<bitr>,<bits>
  <bitr> ::= <integer>|<integer>-<integer>

Input file format:

  HP logic analzyers can provide the captured data in either binary or
  text format.  Depending on the logic analyzer, the data can be transferred
  to a computer via Ethernet, serial, IEEE-488, or floppy disc.

  The binary data format seems to be undocumented and analyzer-
  dependent, so this program only accepts the text format.

  In text format, there is one file for each signal, and optionally a
  file "time_abs.txt" for timestamps and a file "line_num.txt" for
  sample numbers.  There is also a file "1st_line.txt" which we will
  ignore.

  Each file contains a title on its first line, and one data item on
  each successive line.  For the signals, the data items are the actual
  sample values.  For the timestamps, the date items are floating point
  numbers representing time in seconds.

Example:

  la2vcd2 -ta time_abs.txt -r 16 -b 9 -sf 8-5 f1 -sf 4-0 f2 input.txt -o out.vcd

  time_abs.txt is the timestamp file.

  input.txt stores 9 bit wide hexadecimal samples.  It will be divided into
  a four-bit and a five-bit vector, f1 and f2, in out.vcd.

If you run:

sudo make install

It will also install the la2vcd2 library and header file la2vcd2.h.
